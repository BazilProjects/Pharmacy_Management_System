# Introduction
doc.add_heading('Introduction', level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The relationship between stress and reproductive outcomes has garnered increasing interest in "
    "biological and psychological research. Chronic stress is believed to influence hormonal balances "
    "and reproductive strategies, potentially affecting the sex of offspring. This proposal aims to "
    "explore how stress impacts reproductive health, the mechanisms underlying sex ratio adjustments, "
    "and methods for testing sperm concentration types (XX and XY) in a university laboratory setting."
)

# Background and Rationale
doc.add_heading('Background and Rationale', level=2)

# Stress and Reproductive Health
doc.add_heading('1. Stress and Reproductive Health', level=3)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Impact of Stress on Hormones: Chronic stress affects hormonal balances in both men and women. "
    "In men, elevated cortisol levels may negatively impact testosterone, affecting sperm quality and "
    "potentially skewing the sex ratio of offspring."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Adaptive Responses: The body's ability to adapt its reproductive strategy based on environmental "
    "stressors suggests that stress can influence reproductive success by favoring traits advantageous in "
    "specific environments."
)

# Sex Ratio Adjustment Hypothesis
doc.add_heading('2. Sex Ratio Adjustment Hypothesis', level=3)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Theoretical Framework: Parents may adjust the sex ratio of their offspring based on environmental "
    "conditions. In stressful environments, some studies suggest a propensity for male offspring, who may "
    "offer more support in harsh conditions, or female offspring with traits that help them thrive."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Research Evidence: High-stress situations, such as economic hardship or famine, have been linked to "
    "changes in the sex ratio at birth, although this area of research remains complex and somewhat controversial."
)

# Role of Resilience
doc.add_heading('3. Role of Resilience', level=3)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Resilience in Offspring: Stress may influence the resilience of offspring, with traits like stress "
    "resilience potentially being passed on more commonly to daughters in stressful environments."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Sex-Specific Responses: Research indicates that females may develop coping strategies to handle stress "
    "effectively, whereas males may have different responses affecting reproductive outcomes."
)

# Mechanism in Sperm Production
doc.add_heading('4. Mechanism in Sperm Production', level=3)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Sperm Composition: The potential for environmental stress to adjust the concentration of male or female "
    "sperm through biological mechanisms remains an intriguing area for exploration."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "- Evolutionary Perspective: From an evolutionary standpoint, reproductive strategies may adapt to maximize "
    "survival and reproductive success based on environmental conditions, influencing sex ratios."
)

# Cultural and Societal Factors
doc.add_heading('5. Cultural and Societal Factors', level=3)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The role of cultural and societal conditions in determining sex ratios and resilience is essential, "
    "as societal values often influence reproductive strategies and family planning."
)

# Expected Outcomes
doc.add_heading('Expected Outcomes', level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "This research aims to establish a clearer understanding of the relationship between stress and reproductive "
    "outcomes, specifically regarding sex ratio adjustments and sperm composition. The findings may provide insights "
    "into reproductive strategies in the context of environmental stressors."
